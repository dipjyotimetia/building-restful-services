Welcome to the samples repository for course, "Building RESTful Services." The samples in this repository correspond to the various samples that are demonstrated throughout the course and they are organized accordingly by module number. 

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

_NOTE_: In order to run Docker Compose, you will need either an operating system capable of running [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) or an equivalent virtual machine setup. The samples for this repository were originally created using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) and later migrated to use [Docker Native for Mac](https://beta.docker.com/).

## Starting a Sample

* `cd` into the module-specific directory that you wish to run
* Run the command `docker-compose up`
